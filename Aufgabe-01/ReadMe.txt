Data Mining Practical Course 09.04.15+10.04.15

Comments to the data:

Task 3:

income1/income2: data vector of salary in Euro derived from 30/31 persons


Task 5:

min_salary.mat:

This file contains the salary (German: Mindestlöhne) of 7 countries for the year 2012,
so we have an array 1x7 in size. Starting with the first column, the country names are:

Belgium, Greece , Spain, France, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (UK)


#US_birthrates.mat

This file contains the number of live births per 10,000 23-year-old women in the United States 
between 1917 and 1975. 
The array is of size 59x2- in the 1. column are the years and the 2. columns are the rates.


#energy_consumption.mat

This file contains a 22x6 array, hosting energy consumption data from Germany between 
the years 1990-2011 (rows) in 6 sectors (columns):

1.: Unspecified/Other
2. Final Energy Consumption-Transport
3. Final Energy Consumption-Industry
4. Agriculture
5. Residual
6. Services

	
#climate.mat

Global annual temperature anomalies (degrees C) computed using data from
land meteorological stations. The second column contains the 5-year average.
The mean of the data was shifted to 0.0 to show the deviation from the "average temperature of the 20th century".

#stroop.mat

Word count in seconds for female (first column) versus male (second column). 

Reference paper:
Stroop, J.R. (1935). Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 28, 643-662.
Excerpt from the abstract of the paper:
"In this study pairs of conflicting stimuli, both being inherent aspects of the same symbols, were presented simultaneously (a name of one color printed in the ink of another color—a word stimulus and a color stimulus). The difference in time for reading the words printed in colors and the same words printed in black is the measure of the interference of color stimuli upon reading words. The difference in the time for naming the colors in which the words are printed and the same colors printed in squares (or swastikas) is the measure of the interference of conflicting word stimuli upon naming colors. The interference of conflicting color stimuli upon the time for reading 100 words (each word naming a color unlike the ink-color of its print) caused ..."
